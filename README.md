This tic-tac-toe game is a mobile and desktop application that allows two players to play the classic strategy game on a 3x3 grid. Each player takes turns placing their symbol (either an 'X' or an 'O') on the grid, with the goal of getting three in a row before the other player does. The game also features a computer player that uses the mini-max algorithm to make strategic decisions and try to block the human player's attempts to win. Whether playing against a friend or the computer, this game offers a fun and challenging experience for players of all ages.
